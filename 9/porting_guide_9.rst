Ansible 9 Porting Guide
=======================

.. contents::
  :local:
  :depth: 2


Ansible 9 is based on Ansible-core 2.16.


We suggest you read this page along with the `Ansible 9 Changelog <https://github.com/ansible-community/ansible-build-data/blob/main/9/CHANGELOG-v9.rst>`_ to understand what updates you may need to make.


Playbook
========

* Conditionals - due to mitigation of security issue CVE-2023-5764 in ansible-core 2.16.1,
  conditional expressions with embedded template blocks can fail with the message
  "``Conditional is marked as unsafe, and cannot be evaluated.``" when an embedded template
  consults data from untrusted sources like module results or vars marked ``!unsafe``.
  Conditionals with embedded templates can be a source of malicious template injection when
  referencing untrusted data, and can nearly always be rewritten without embedded
  templates. Playbook task conditional keywords such as ``when`` and ``until`` have long
  displayed warnings discouraging use of embedded templates in conditionals; this warning
  has been expanded to non-task conditionals as well, such as the ``assert`` action.

  .. code-block:: yaml

     - name: task with a module result (always untrusted by Ansible)
       shell: echo "hi mom"
       register: untrusted_result

     # don't do it this way...
     # - name: insecure conditional with embedded template consulting untrusted data
     #   assert:
     #     that: '"hi mom" is in {{ untrusted_result.stdout }}'

     - name: securely access untrusted values directly as Jinja variables instead
       assert:
         that: '"hi mom" is in untrusted_result.stdout'

Known Issues
------------

Ansible-core
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- ansible-galaxy - dies in the middle of installing a role when that role contains Java inner classes (files with $ in the file name).  This is by design, to exclude temporary or backup files. (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/81553).
- ansible-test - The ``pep8`` sanity test is unable to detect f-string spacing issues (E201, E202) on Python 3.10 and 3.11. They are correctly detected under Python 3.12. See (https://github.com/PyCQA/pycodestyle/issues/1190).

Breaking Changes
----------------

Ansible-core
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Any plugin using the config system and the `cli` entry to use the `timeout` from the command line, will see the value change if the use had configured it in any of the lower precedence methods. If relying on this behaviour to consume the global/generic timeout from the DEFAULT_TIMEOUT constant, please consult the documentation on plugin configuration to add the overlaping entries.
- ansible-test - Test plugins that rely on containers no longer support reusing running containers. The previous behavior was an undocumented, untested feature.
- service module will not permanently configure variables/flags for openbsd when doing enable/disable operation anymore, this module was never meant to do this type of work, just to manage the service state itself. A rcctl_config or similar module should be created and used instead.

amazon.aws
~~~~~~~~~~

- The amazon.aws collection has dropped support for ``botocore<1.29.0`` and ``boto3<1.26.0``.

- vmware_vm_info - added prefix length to IP addresses in vm_network, so they now show up as for example 10.76.33.228/24 instead of just 10.76.33.228 (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.vmware/issues/1761).

dellemc.enterprise_sonic
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- servicenow.servicenow (previously included version: 1.0.6)

Removed Features
----------------

- The deprecated servicenow.servicenow collection has been removed from Ansible 7, but accidentally re-added to Ansible 8. It has been removed again from Ansible 9 (https://github.com/ansible-community/community-topics/issues/246).
- The ngine_io.vultr collection has been removed from Ansible 9, because it is officially unmaintained and has been archived. The successor collection ``vultr.cloud`` (using the recent v2 Vultr API) covers the same functionality but might not have compatible syntax (https://github.com/ansible-community/community-topics/issues/257).
- ``cisco.nso`` was considered unmaintained and removed from Ansible 9 as per the `removal from Ansible process <https://github.com/ansible-collections/overview/blob/main/removal_from_ansible.rst#unmaintained-collections>`_. Users can still install this collection with ``ansible-galaxy collection install cisco.nso``.
- ``community.fortios`` was considered unmaintained and removed from Ansible 9 as per the `removal from Ansible process <https://github.com/ansible-collections/overview/blob/main/removal_from_ansible.rst#unmaintained-collections>`_. Users can still install this collection with ``ansible-galaxy collection install community.fortios``.
- ``community.google`` was considered unmaintained and removed from Ansible 9 as per the `removal from Ansible process <https://github.com/ansible-collections/overview/blob/main/removal_from_ansible.rst#unmaintained-collections>`_. Users can still install this collection with ``ansible-galaxy collection install community.google``.
- ``community.skydive`` was considered unmaintained and removed from Ansible 9 as per the `removal from Ansible process <https://github.com/ansible-collections/overview/blob/main/removal_from_ansible.rst#unmaintained-collections>`_. Users can still install this collection with ``ansible-galaxy collection install community.skydive``.

Ansible-core
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- ActionBase - remove deprecated ``_remote_checksum`` method
- PlayIterator - remove deprecated ``cache_block_tasks`` and ``get_original_task`` methods
- Remove deprecated ``FileLock`` class
- Removed Python 3.9 as a supported version on the controller. Python 3.10 or newer is required.
- Removed ``include`` which has been deprecated in Ansible 2.12. Use ``include_tasks`` or ``import_tasks`` instead.
- ``Templar`` - remove deprecated ``shared_loader_obj`` parameter of ``__init__``
- ``fetch_url`` - remove auto disabling ``decompress`` when gzip is not available
- ``get_action_args_with_defaults`` - remove deprecated ``redirected_names`` method parameter
- ansible-test - Removed support for the remote Windows targets 2012 and 2012-R2
- inventory_cache - remove deprecated ``default.fact_caching_prefix`` ini configuration option, use ``defaults.fact_caching_prefix`` instead.

ansible.windows
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- win_get_url - Removed the deprecated option alias ``passwordd``, use ``url_password`` instead.
- win_get_url - Removed the deprecated option alias ``user`` and ``username``, use ``url_username`` instead.
- win_package - Removed deprecated module option ``ensure``, use ``state`` instead.
- win_package - Removed deprecated module option ``productid``, use ``product_id`` instead.
- win_package - Removed deprecated module option ``username``, ``user_name``, ``password``, and ``user_password``. Use ``become`` with ``become_flags: logon_type=new_credentials logon_flags=netcredentials_only`` on the task instead to replicate the same functionality instead.
- win_reboot - Removed backwards compatibility check where ``ignore_errors: true`` will be treated like ``ignore_unreachable: true``. Going forward ``ignore_errors: true`` will only ignore errors the plugin encountered and not an unreachable host. Use ``ignore_unreachable: true`` to ignore that error like any other module.
- win_regedit - Removed support for using a ``path`` with forward slashes as a key separator. Using a forward slash has been deprecated since Ansible 2.9. If using forward slashes in the ``win_regedit`` ``path`` value, make sure to change the forward slash ``/`` to a backslash ``\``. If enclosed in double quotes the backslash will have to be doubled up.
- win_updates - Removed deprecated alias ``blacklist``, use ``reject_list`` instead.
- win_updates - Removed deprecated alias ``whitelist``, use ``accept_list`` instead.
- win_updates - Removed deprecated module option ``use_scheduled_task``. This option did not change any functionality in the module and can be safely removed from the task entry.

- Support for Windows Server 2012 and 2012 R2 has been removed as the support end of life from Microsoft is October 10th 2023. These versions of Windows will no longer be tested in this Ansible release and it cannot be guaranteed that they will continue to work going forward.

- The next major release, community.general 8.0.0, will drop support for ansible-core 2.11 and 2.12, which have been End of Life for some time now. This means that this collection no longer supports Python 2.6 on the target. Individual content might still work with unsupported ansible-core versions, but that can change at any time. Also please note that from now on, for every new major community.general release, we will drop support for all ansible-core versions that have been End of Life for more than a few weeks on the date of the major release (https://github.com/ansible-community/community-topics/discussions/271, https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/pull/7259).

- redhat module utils - the ``module_utils.redhat`` module is deprecated, as
  effectively unused: the ``Rhsm``, ``RhsmPool``, and ``RhsmPools`` classes
  will be removed in community.general 9.0.0; the ``RegistrationBase`` class
  will be removed in community.general 10.0.0 together with the
  ``rhn_register`` module, as it is the only user of this class; this means
  that the whole ``module_utils.redhat`` module will be dropped in
  community.general 10.0.0, so importing it without even using anything of it
  will fail
  (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/pull/6663).
- redhat_subscription - the ``autosubscribe`` alias for the ``auto_attach`` option has been
  deprecated for many years, although only in the documentation. Officially mark this alias

  more precise and flexible ``pool_ids`` option
  (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/pull/6650).
- rhsm_repository - ``state=present`` has not been working as expected for many years,
  and it seems it was not noticed so far; also, "presence" is not really a valid concept
  for subscription repositories, which can only be enabled or disabled. Hence, mark the
  ``present`` and ``absent`` values of the ``state`` option as deprecated, slating them
  for removal in community.general 10.0.0
  (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/pull/6673).
