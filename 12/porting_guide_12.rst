Porting Guide for v12.0.0a1
===========================

Added Collections
-----------------

- hitachivantara.vspone_block (version 3.3.0)
- microsoft.iis (version 1.0.2)

Known Issues
------------

Ansible-core
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- templating - Any string value starting with ``#jinja2:`` which is templated will always be interpreted as Jinja2 configuration overrides. To include this literal value at the start of a string, a space or other character must precede it.
- variables - Tagged values cannot be used for dictionary keys in many circumstances.
- variables - The values ``None``, ``True`` and ``False`` cannot be tagged because they are singletons. Attempts to apply tags to these values will be silently ignored.

dellemc.openmanage
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- idrac_diagnostics - Issue(285322) - This module doesn't support export of diagnostics file to HTTP and HTTPS share via SOCKS proxy.
- idrac_firmware - Issue(279282) - This module does not support firmware update using HTTP, HTTPS, and FTP shares with authentication on iDRAC8.
- ome_smart_fabric_uplink - Issue(186024) - The module supported by OpenManage Enterprise Modular, however it does not allow the creation of multiple uplinks of the same name. If an uplink is created using the same name as an existing uplink, then the existing uplink is modified.

purestorage.flasharray
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- All Fusion fleet members will be assumed to be at the same Purity//FA version level as the array connected to by Ansible.
- FlashArray//CBS is not currently supported as a member of a Fusion fleet

Breaking Changes
----------------

Ansible-core
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Support for the ``toml`` library has been removed from TOML inventory parsing and dumping. Use ``tomli`` for parsing on Python 3.10. Python 3.11 and later have built-in support for parsing. Use ``tomli-w`` to support outputting inventory in TOML format.
- assert - The ``quiet`` argument must be a commonly-accepted boolean value. Previously, unrecognized values were silently treated as False.
- callback plugins - The structure of the ``exception``, ``warnings`` and ``deprecations`` values visible to callbacks has changed. Callbacks that inspect or serialize these values may require special handling.
- conditionals - Conditional expressions that result in non-boolean values are now an error by default. Such results often indicate unintentional use of templates where they are not supported, resulting in a conditional that is always true. When this option is enabled, conditional expressions which are a literal ``None`` or empty string will evaluate as true, for backwards compatibility. The error can be temporarily changed to a deprecation warning by enabling the ``ALLOW_BROKEN_CONDITIONALS`` config option.
- first_found lookup - When specifying ``files`` or ``paths`` as a templated list containing undefined values, the undefined list elements will be discarded with a warning. Previously, the entire list would be discarded without any warning.
- internals - The ``AnsibleLoader`` and ``AnsibleDumper`` classes for working with YAML are now factory functions and cannot be extended.
- internals - The ``ansible.utils.native_jinja`` Python module has been removed.
- inventory - Invalid variable names provided by inventories result in an inventory parse failure. This behavior is now consistent with other variable name usages throughout Ansible.
- lookup plugins - Lookup plugins called as `with_(lookup)` will no longer have the `_subdir` attribute set.
- lookup plugins - ``terms`` will always be passed to ``run`` as the first positional arg, where previously it was sometimes passed as a keyword arg when using ``with_`` syntax.
- loops - Omit placeholders no longer leak between loop item templating and task templating. Previously, ``omit`` placeholders could remain embedded in loop items after templating and be used as an ``omit`` for task templating. Now, values resolving to ``omit`` are dropped immediately when loop items are templated. To turn missing values into an ``omit`` for task templating, use ``| default(omit)``. This solution is backwards compatible with previous versions of ansible-core.
- modules - Ansible modules using ``sys.excepthook`` must use a standard ``try/except`` instead.
- plugins - Any plugin that sources or creates templates must properly tag them as trusted.
- plugins - Custom Jinja plugins that accept undefined top-level arguments must opt in to receiving them.
- plugins - Custom Jinja plugins that use ``environment.getitem`` to retrieve undefined values will now trigger a ``MarkerError`` exception. This exception must be handled to allow the plugin to return a ``Marker``, or the plugin must opt-in to accepting ``Marker`` values.
- public API - The ``ansible.vars.fact_cache.FactCache`` wrapper has been removed.
- serialization of ``omit`` sentinel - Serialization of variables containing ``omit`` sentinels (e.g., by the ``to_json`` and ``to_yaml`` filters or ``ansible-inventory``) will fail if the variable has not completed templating. Previously, serialization succeeded with placeholder strings emitted in the serialized output.
- set_fact - The string values "yes", "no", "true" and "false" were previously converted (ignoring case) to boolean values when not using Jinja2 native mode. Since Jinja2 native mode is always used, this conversion no longer occurs. When boolean values are required, native boolean syntax should be used where variables are defined, such as in YAML. When native boolean syntax is not an option, the ``bool`` filter can be used to parse string values into booleans.
- template lookup - The ``convert_data`` option is deprecated and no longer has any effect. Use the ``from_json`` filter on the lookup result instead.
- templating - Access to ``_`` prefixed attributes and methods, and methods with known side effects, is no longer permitted. In cases where a matching mapping key is present, the associated value will be returned instead of an error. This increases template environment isolation and ensures more consistent behavior between the ``.`` and ``[]`` operators.
- templating - Conditionals and lookups which use embedded inline templates in Jinja string constants now display a warning. These templates should be converted to their expression equivalent.
- templating - Many Jinja plugins (filters, lookups, tests) and methods previously silently ignored undefined inputs, which often masked subtle errors. Passing an undefined argument to a Jinja plugin or method that does not declare undefined support now results in an undefined value.
- templating - Templates are always rendered in Jinja2 native mode. As a result, non-string values are no longer automatically converted to strings.
- templating - Templates resulting in ``None`` are no longer automatically converted to an empty string.
- templating - Templates with embedded inline templates that were not contained within a Jinja string constant now result in an error, as support for multi-pass templating was removed for security reasons. In most cases, such templates can be easily rewritten to avoid the use of embedded inline templates.
- templating - The ``allow_unsafe_lookups`` option no longer has any effect. Lookup plugins are responsible for tagging strings containing templates to allow evaluation as a template.
- templating - The result of the ``range()`` global function cannot be returned from a template- it should always be passed to a filter (e.g., ``random``). Previously, range objects returned from an intermediate template were always converted to a list, which is inconsistent with inline consumption of range objects.
- templating - ``#jinja2:`` overrides in templates with invalid override names or types are now templating errors.

ansible.posix
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- firewalld - Changed the type of forward and masquerade options from str to bool (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ansible.posix/issues/582).
- firewalld - Changed the type of icmp_block_inversion option from str to bool (https://github.com/ansible-collections/ansible.posix/issues/586).

community.postgresql
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- postgresql_info - the ``db`` alias is deprecated and will be removed in the next major release, use the ``login_db`` argument instead.
- postgresql_pg_hba - regarding #776 'keep_comments_at_rules' has been deprecated and won't do anything, the default is to keep the comments at the rules they are specified with. keep_comments_at_rules will be removed in 5.0.0 (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.postgresql/pull/778)
- postgresql_user - the ``db`` alias is deprecated and will be removed in the next major release, use the ``login_db`` argument instead.

dellemc.enterprise_sonic
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- sonic_aaa - Update AAA module to align with SONiC functionality (https://github.com/ansible-collections/dellemc.enterprise_sonic/pull/382).
- sonic_bgp_communities - Change 'aann' option as a suboption of 'members' and update its type from string to list of strings (https://github.com/ansible-collections/dellemc.enterprise_sonic/pull/440).
- sonic_route_maps - Change the 'set ip_next_hop' option from a single-line option to a dictionary (https://github.com/ansible-collection/dellemc.enterprise_sonic/pull/421).
- sonic_vlan_mapping - New vlan_mapping resource module. The users of the vlan_mapping resource module with playbooks written for the SONiC 4.1 will need to revise their playbooks based on the new argspec to use those playbooks for SONiC 4.2 and later versions. (https://github.com/ansible-collections/dellemc.enterprise_sonic/pull/296).

theforeman.foreman
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Drop support for Ansible 2.9.
- Drop support for Python 2.7 and 3.5.

Major Changes
-------------

Ansible-core
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Jinja plugins - Jinja builtin filter and test plugins are now accessible via their fully-qualified names ``ansible.builtin.{name}``.
- Task Execution / Forks - Forks no longer inherit stdio from the parent ``ansible-playbook`` process. ``stdout``, ``stderr``, and ``stdin`` within a worker are detached from the terminal, and non-functional. All needs to access stdio from a fork for controller side plugins requires use of ``Display``.
- ansible-test - Packages beneath ``module_utils`` can now contain ``__init__.py`` files.
- variables - The type system underlying Ansible's variable storage has been significantly overhauled and formalized. Attempts to store unsupported Python object types in variables will now result in an error.
- variables - To support new Ansible features, many variable objects are now represented by subclasses of their respective native Python types. In most cases, they behave indistinguishably from their original types, but some Python libraries do not handle builtin object subclasses properly. Custom plugins that interact with such libraries may require changes to convert and pass the native types.

Deprecated Features
-------------------

Ansible-core
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- CLI - The ``--inventory-file`` option alias is deprecated. Use the ``-i`` or ``--inventory`` option instead.
- Stategy Plugins - Use of strategy plugins not provided in ``ansible.builtin`` are deprecated and do not carry any backwards compatibility guarantees going forward. A future release will remove the ability to use external strategy plugins. No alternative for third party strategy plugins is currently planned.
- ``ansible.module_utils.compat.datetime`` - The datetime compatibility shims are now deprecated. They are scheduled to be removed in ``ansible-core`` v2.21. This includes ``UTC``, ``utcfromtimestamp()`` and ``utcnow`` importable from said module (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/81874).
- bool filter - Support for coercing unrecognized input values (including None) has been deprecated. Consult the filter documentation for acceptable values, or consider use of the ``truthy`` and ``falsy`` tests.
- cache plugins - The `ansible.plugins.cache.base` Python module is deprecated. Use `ansible.plugins.cache` instead.
- callback plugins - The `v2_on_any` callback method is deprecated. Use specific callback methods instead.
- callback plugins - The v1 callback API (callback methods not prefixed with `v2_`) is deprecated. Use `v2_` prefixed methods instead.
- conditionals - Conditionals using Jinja templating delimiters (e.g., ``{{``, ``{%``) should be rewritten as expressions without delimiters, unless the entire conditional value is a single template that resolves to a trusted string expression. This is useful for dynamic indirection of conditional expressions, but is limited to trusted literal string expressions.
- config - The ``ACTION_WARNINGS`` config has no effect. It previously disabled command warnings, which have since been removed.
- config - The ``DEFAULT_JINJA2_NATIVE`` option has no effect. Jinja2 native mode is now the default and only option.
- config - The ``DEFAULT_NULL_REPRESENTATION`` option has no effect. Null values are no longer automatically converted to another value during templating of single variable references.
- display - The ``Display.get_deprecation_message`` method has been deprecated. Call ``Display.deprecated`` to display a deprecation message, or call it with ``removed=True`` to raise an ``AnsibleError``.
- file loading - Loading text files with ``DataLoader`` containing data that cannot be decoded under the expected encoding is deprecated. In most cases the encoding must be UTF-8, although some plugins allow choosing a different encoding. Previously, invalid data was silently wrapped in Unicode surrogate escape sequences, often resulting in later errors or other data corruption.
- first_found lookup - Splitting of file paths on ``,;:`` is deprecated. Pass a list of paths instead. The ``split`` method on strings can be used to split variables into a list as needed.
- interpreter discovery - The ``auto_legacy`` and ``auto_legacy_silent`` options for ``INTERPRETER_PYTHON`` are deprecated. Use ``auto`` or ``auto_silent`` options instead, as they have the same effect.
- oneline callback - The ``oneline`` callback and its associated ad-hoc CLI args (``-o``, ``--one-line``) are deprecated.
- paramiko - The paramiko connection plugin has been deprecated with planned removal in 2.21.
- playbook variables - The ``play_hosts`` variable has been deprecated, use ``ansible_play_batch`` instead.
- plugin error handling - The ``AnsibleError`` constructor arg ``suppress_extended_error`` is deprecated. Using ``suppress_extended_error=True`` has the same effect as ``show_content=False``.
- plugins - The ``listify_lookup_plugin_terms`` function is obsolete and in most cases no longer needed.
- template lookup - The jinja2_native option is no longer used in the Ansible Core code base. Jinja2 native mode is now the default and only option.
- templating - Support for enabling Jinja2 extensions (not plugins) has been deprecated.
- templating - The ``ansible_managed`` variable available for certain templating scenarios, such as the ``template`` action and ``template`` lookup has been deprecated. Define and use a custom variable instead of relying on ``ansible_managed``.
- templating - The ``disable_lookups`` option has no effect, since plugins must be updated to apply trust before any templating can be performed.
- to_yaml/to_nice_yaml filters - Implicit YAML dumping of vaulted value ciphertext is deprecated. Set `dump_vault_tags` to explicitly specify the desired behavior.
- tree callback - The ``tree`` callback and its associated ad-hoc CLI args (``-t``, ``--tree``) are deprecated.
