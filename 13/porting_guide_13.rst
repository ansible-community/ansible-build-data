Ansible 13 Porting Guide
========================

.. contents::
  :depth: 2


Ansible 13 is based on Ansible-core 2.20.

We suggest you read this page along with the `Ansible 13 Changelog <https://github.com/ansible-community/ansible-build-data/blob/main/13/CHANGELOG-v13.md>`_ to understand what updates you may need to make.

.. _2.20_introduction:

Introduction
============

No notable changes

.. _2.20_playbook:

Playbook
========

Removed quote stripping in PowerShell operations
-------------------------------------------------

The PowerShell module utilities no longer attempt to remove quotes from paths when performing Windows operations like copying and fetching files. This should not affect normal playbooks unless a value is quoted too many times. If you have playbooks that rely on this automatic quote removal, you will need to adjust your path formatting.

.. _2.20_engine:

Engine
======

No notable changes

.. _2.20_plugin_api:

Plugin API
==========

Removed Features
----------------

The following previously deprecated features have been removed:

* The ``DEFAULT_TRANSPORT`` configuration option no longer supports the ``smart`` value that selected the default transport as either ``ssh`` or ``paramiko`` based on the underlying platform configuration.
* The ``vault`` and ``unvault`` filters no longer accept the deprecated ``vaultid`` parameter.
* The ``ansible-galaxy`` command no longer supports the v2 Galaxy server API. Galaxy servers hosting collections must support v3.
* The ``dnf`` and ``dnf5`` modules no longer support the deprecated ``install_repoquery`` option.
* The ``encrypt`` module utility no longer includes the deprecated ``passlib_or_crypt`` API.
* The ``paramiko`` connection plugin no longer supports the ``PARAMIKO_HOST_KEY_AUTO_ADD`` and ``PARAMIKO_LOOK_FOR_KEYS`` configuration keys, which were previously deprecated.
* The ``py3compat.environ`` call has been removed.
* Vars plugins that do not inherit from ``BaseVarsPlugin`` and define a ``get_vars`` method can no longer use the deprecated ``get_host_vars`` or ``get_group_vars`` fallback.
* The ``yum_repository`` module no longer supports the deprecated ``keepcache`` option.

Behavioral Changes
------------------

* The ``DataLoader.get_basedir`` method now returns an absolute path instead of a relative path. Plugin code that relies on relative paths may need adjustment.
* Argument spec validation now treats ``None`` values as empty strings for the ``str`` type for better consistency with pre-2.19 templating conversions.
* When using ``failed_when`` to suppress an error, the ``exception`` key in the result is now renamed to ``failed_when_suppressed_exception``. This prevents the error from being displayed by callbacks after being suppressed. If you have playbooks that check for the exception in the result, update them as follows:

.. code-block:: yaml+jinja

    # Before
    - command: /bin/false
      register: result
      failed_when: false

    - debug:
        msg: "Exception was: {{ result.exception }}"
      when: result.exception is defined

    # After
    - command: /bin/false
      register: result
      failed_when: false

    - debug:
        msg: "Exception was: {{ result.failed_when_suppressed_exception }}"
      when: result.failed_when_suppressed_exception is defined

.. _2.20_command_line:

Command Line
============

* Python 3.11 is no longer a supported control node version. Python 3.12+ is now required for running Ansible.
* Python 3.8 is no longer a supported remote version. Python 3.9+ is now required for target execution.

.. _2.20_deprecated:

Deprecated
==========

INJECT_FACTS_AS_VARS
--------------------

The ``INJECT_FACTS_AS_VARS`` configuration currently defaults to ``True``, but this is now deprecated and it will switch to ``False`` in Ansible 2.24.

When enabled, facts are available both inside the ``ansible_facts`` dictionary and as individual variables in the main namespace. In the ``ansible_facts`` dictionary, the ``ansible_`` prefix is removed from fact names.

You will receive deprecation warnings if you are accessing 'injected' facts. To prepare for the future default:

**Update your playbooks to use the ansible_facts dictionary:**

.. code-block:: yaml+jinja

    # Deprecated - will stop working in 2.24
    - debug:
        msg: "OS: {{ ansible_os_distribution }}"

    # Recommended - works in all versions
    - debug:
        msg: "OS: {{ ansible_facts['distribution'] }}"
        # Note: 'ansible_' prefix is removed inside ansible_facts

**Or explicitly enable the current behavior in your configuration:**

In your ``ansible.cfg`` file:

.. code-block:: ini

    [defaults]
    inject_facts_as_vars = True

By exporting an environment variable:

.. code-block:: shell

    export ANSIBLE_INJECT_FACT_VARS=True

Other Deprecations
------------------

* The ``vars`` internal variable cache will be removed in 2.24. This cache, once used internally, exposes variables in inconsistent states. The ``vars`` and ``varnames`` lookups should be used instead.
* Specifying ``ignore_files`` as a string in the ``include_vars`` module is deprecated. Use a list instead:

.. code-block:: yaml

    # Deprecated
    - include_vars:
        dir: vars/
        ignore_files: ".gitkeep"

    # Correct
    - include_vars:
        dir: vars/
        ignore_files: [".gitkeep"]

.. _2.20_modules:

Modules
=======

Modules removed
---------------

The following modules no longer exist:

* No notable changes

Deprecation notices
-------------------

No notable changes

Noteworthy module changes
-------------------------

* The ``include_vars`` module now raises an error if the ``extensions`` parameter is not specified as a list. Previously, non-list values were silently accepted.
* The ``include_vars`` module now raises an error if the ``ignore_files`` parameter is not specified as a list. Previously, string values were accepted but are now deprecated.
* The ``replace`` module now reads and writes files in text-mode as unicode characters instead of as bytes, and switches regex matching to unicode characters instead of bytes. This may affect playbooks that rely on byte-level operations.

Porting Guide for v13.0.0b1
===========================

Known Issues
------------

community.sops
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- When using the ``community.sops.load_vars`` with ansible-core 2.20, note that the deprecation of ``INJECT_FACTS_AS_VARS`` causes deprecation warnings to be shown every time a variable loaded with ``community.sops.load_vars`` is used. This is due to ansible-core deprecating ``INJECT_FACTS_AS_VARS`` without providing an alternative for modules like ``community.sops.load_vars`` to use. If you do not like these deprecation warnings, you have to explicitly set ``INJECT_FACTS_AS_VARS`` to ``true``. **DO NOT** change the use of SOPS encrypted variables to ``ansible_facts``. The situation will hopefully improve in ansible-core 2.21 through the promised API that allows action plugins to set variables; community.sops will adapt to use it, which will make the warning go away. (The API was originally promised for ansible-core 2.20, but then delayed.)

Breaking Changes
----------------

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Since version 4.0.0, the collection accepts code written in Python 3. Modules aren't tested against Python 2 and might not work in Python 2 environments.
- collection - stop testing against mysqlclient connector as its support was deprecated in this collection - use PyMySQL connector instead! It'll stop working in 5.0.0 when we remove all related code (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.mysql/issues/654).
- mysql_db - the ``pipefail`` argument's default value is set to ``true``.  If your target machines do not use ``bash`` as a default interpreter, set ``pipefail`` to ``false`` explicitly. However, we strongly recommend setting up ``bash`` as a default and ``pipefail=true`` as it will protect you from getting broken dumps you don't know about (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.mysql/issues/407).
- mysql_info - The ``users_info`` filter does not return the ``plugin_auth_string`` field anymore. Use the `plugin_hash_string` return value instead (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.mysql/pull/629).
- mysql_role - the ``column_case_sensitive`` argument's default value has been changed to ``true``. If your playbook expected the column to be automatically uppercased for your users privileges, you should set this to ``false`` explicitly (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.mysql/issues/578).
- mysql_user - the ``column_case_sensitive`` argument's default value has been changed to ``true``. If your playbook expected the column to be automatically uppercased for your users privileges, you should set this to ``false`` explicitly (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.mysql/issues/577).

Deprecated Features
-------------------

Ansible-core
^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Deprecated the shell plugin's ``wrap_for_exec`` function. This API is not used in Ansible or any known collection and is being removed to simplify the plugin API. Plugin authors should wrap their command to execute within an explicit shell or other known executable.
- INJECT_FACTS_AS_VARS configuration currently defaults to ``True``, this is now deprecated and it will switch to ``False`` by Ansible 2.24. You will only get notified if you are accessing 'injected' facts (for example, ansible_os_distribution vs ansible_facts['os_distribution']).
- hash_params function in roles/__init__ is being deprecated as it is not in use.
- include_vars - Specifying 'ignore_files' as a string is deprecated.
- vars, the internal variable cache will be removed in 2.24. This cache, once used internally exposes variables in inconsistent states, the 'vars' and 'varnames' lookups should be used instead.
