Porting Guide for v13.0.0a2
===========================

Added Collections
-----------------

- hitachivantara.vspone_object (version 1.0.0)

Known Issues
------------

dellemc.openmanage
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Formal qualification of module ome_smart_fabric_info for Ansible Core version 2.19 is still pending.
- idrac_diagnostics - This module does not support export of diagnostics file to HTTP and HTTPS share via SOCKS proxy.
- idrac_license - Due to API limitation, proxy parameters are ignored during the import operation.
- idrac_license - The module will give different error messages for iDRAC9 and iDRAC10 when user imports license with invalid share name.
- idrac_os_deployment - The module continues to return a 200 response and marks the job as completed, even when an outdated date is supplied in the Expose duration.
- idrac_redfish_storage_controller - PatrolReadRatePercent attribute cannot be set in iDRAC10.
- idrac_server_config_profile - When attempting to revert iDRAC settings using a previously exported SCP file, the import operation will complete with errors if a new user was created after the export (Instead of restoring the system to its previous state, including the removal of newly added users).
- idrac_system_info - The module will show empty video list despite having Embedded VIDEO controller.
- ome_smart_fabric_uplink - The module supported by OpenManage Enterprise Modular, however it does not allow the creation of multiple uplinks of the same name. If an uplink is created using the same name as an existing uplink, then the existing uplink is modified.
- redfish_storage_volume - Encryption type and block_io_size bytes will be read only property in iDRAC9 and iDRAC10 and hence the module ignores these parameters.

- templating - Exceptions raised in a Jinja ``set`` or ``with`` block which are not accessed by the template are ignored in the same manner as undefined values.

Breaking Changes
----------------

Ansible-core
^^^^^^^^^^^^

- powershell - Removed code that tried to remote quotes from paths when performing Windows operations like copying and fetching file. This should not affect normal playbooks unless a value is quoted too many times.

community.mysql
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Since version 4.0.0, the collection accepts code written in Python 3. Modules aren't tested against Python 2 and might not work in Python 2 environments.
- collection - stop testing against mysqlclient connector as its support was deprecated in this collection - use PyMySQL connector instead! It'll stop working in 5.0.0 when we remove all related code (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.mysql/issues/654).
- mysql_db - the ``pipefail`` argument's default value is set to ``true``.  If your target machines do not use ``bash`` as a default interpreter, set ``pipefail`` to ``false`` explicitly. However, we strongly recommend setting up ``bash`` as a default and ``pipefail=true`` as it will protect you from getting broken dumps you don't know about (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.mysql/issues/407).
- mysql_info - The ``users_info`` filter does not return the ``plugin_auth_string`` field anymore. Use the `plugin_hash_string` return value instead (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.mysql/pull/629).
- mysql_role - the ``column_case_sensitive`` argument's default value has been changed to ``true``. If your playbook expected the column to be automatically uppercased for your users privileges, you should set this to ``false`` explicitly (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.mysql/issues/578).
- mysql_user - the ``column_case_sensitive`` argument's default value has been changed to ``true``. If your playbook expected the column to be automatically uppercased for your users privileges, you should set this to ``false`` explicitly (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.mysql/issues/577).

community.vmware
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Removed support for ansible-core < 2.19.0.
- Removed support for vmware.vmware < 2.0.0.
- Replace the dependencies on ``pyvmomi``, ``vmware-vcenter`` and ``vmware-vapi-common-client`` with ``vcf-sdk`` (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.vmware/pull/2457).

ibm.storage_virtualize
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- ibm_sv_manage_flashsystem_grid - The flashsystem grid module now uses newer FlashSystem REST APIs to perform tasks.

Major Changes
-------------

Ansible-core
^^^^^^^^^^^^

- ansible - Add support for Python 3.14.
- ansible - Drop support for Python 3.11 on the controller.
- ansible - Drop support for Python 3.8 on targets.

community.vmware
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Re-use code from ``vmware.vmware`` (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.vmware/pull/2459).

Deprecated Features
-------------------

Ansible-core
^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Deprecated the shell plugin's ``wrap_for_exec`` function. This API is not used in Ansible or any known collection and is being removed to simplify the plugin API. Plugin authors should wrap their command to execute within an explicit shell or other known executable.
- INJECT_FACTS_AS_VARS configuration currently defaults to ``True``, this is now deprecated and it will switch to ``False`` by Ansible 2.24. You will only get notified if you are accessing 'injected' facts (for example, ansible_os_distribution vs ansible_facts['os_distribution']).
- hash_params function in roles/__init__ is being deprecated as it is not in use.
- include_vars - Specifying 'ignore_files' as a string is deprecated.
- vars, the internal variable cache will be removed in 2.24. This cache, once used internally exposes variables in inconsistent states, the 'vars' and 'varnames' lookups should be used instead.

community.general
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- hiera lookup plugin - retrieving data with Hiera has been deprecated a long time ago; because of that this plugin will be removed from community.general 13.0.0. If you disagree with this deprecation, please create an issue in the community.general repository (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/issues/4462, https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/pull/10779).
