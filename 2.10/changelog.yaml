    changes:
      breaking_changes:
      - amazon.aws.aws_s3 - can now delete versioned buckets even when they are not
        empty - set mode to delete to delete a versioned bucket and everything in
        it.
      - "ansible.windows.win_find - module has been refactored to better match the
        behaviour of the ``find`` module. Here is what has changed:\n  * When the
        directory specified by ``paths`` does not exist or is a file, it will no longer
        fail and will just warn the user\n  * Junction points are no longer reported
        as ``islnk``, use ``isjunction`` to properly report these files. This behaviour
        matches the ansible.windows.win_stat module\n  * Directories no longer return
        a ``size``, this matches the ``stat`` and ``find`` behaviour and has been
        removed due to the difficulties in correctly reporting the size of a directory\n"
      - cisco.nxos.nxos_igmp_interface - no longer supports the deprecated ``oif_prefix``
        and ``oif_source`` options. These have been superceeded by ``oif_ps``.
      - community.grafana.grafana_dashboard - the parameter ``message`` is renamed
        to ``commit_message`` since ``message`` is used by Ansible Core engine internally.
      - community.vmware.vmware_datastore_maintenancemode - now returns ``datastore_status``
        instead of Ansible internal key ``results``.
      - community.vmware.vmware_guest_custom_attributes - does not require VM name
        which was a required parameter for releases prior to Ansible 2.10.
      - community.vmware.vmware_guest_find - the ``datacenter`` option has been removed.
      - community.vmware.vmware_host_kernel_manager - now returns ``host_kernel_status``
        instead of Ansible internal key ``results``.
      - community.vmware.vmware_host_ntp - now returns ``host_ntp_status`` instead
        of Ansible internal key ``results``.
      - community.vmware.vmware_host_service_manager - now returns ``host_service_status``
        instead of Ansible internal key ``results``.
      - community.vmware.vmware_tag - now returns ``tag_status`` instead of Ansible
        internal key ``results``.
      - community.vmware.vmware_vmkernel - the options ``ip_address`` and ``subnet_mask``
        have been removed; use the suboptions ``ip_address`` and ``subnet_mask`` of
        the ``network`` option instead.
      - community.windows.win_pester - no longer runs all ``*.ps1`` file in the directory
        specified due to it executing potentially unknown scripts. It will follow
        the default behaviour of only running tests for files that are like ``*.tests.ps1``
        which is built into Pester itself.
      - purestorage.flashblade.purefb_fs - no longer supports the deprecated ``nfs``
        option. This has been superceeded by ``nfsv3``.
      deprecated_features:
      - The community.vmware.vmware_dns_config module has been deprecated and will
        be removed in a later release; use community.vmware.vmware_host_dns instead.
      - The vyos.vyos.vyos_static_route module has been deprecated and will be removed
        in a later release; use vyos.vyos.vyos_static_routes instead.
      - amazon.aws.cloudformation - the ``template_format`` option has been deprecated
        and will be removed in a later release. It has been ignored by the module
        since Ansible 2.3.
      - amazon.aws.ec2 - in a later release, the ``group`` and ``group_id`` options
        will become mutually exclusive.  Currently ``group_id`` is ignored if you
        pass both.
      - amazon.aws.ec2_key - the ``wait_timeout`` option has been deprecated and will
        be removed in a later release. It has had no effect since Ansible 2.5.
      - amazon.aws.ec2_key - the ``wait`` option has been deprecated and will be removed
        in a later release. It has had no effect since Ansible 2.5.
      - amazon.aws.ec2_tag - support for ``list`` as a state has been deprecated and
        will be removed in a later release.  The ``ec2_tag_info`` can be used to fetch
        the tags on an EC2 resource.
      - ansible.windows.win_domain_controller - the ``log_path`` option has been deprecated
        and will be removed in a later release. This was undocumented and only related
        to debugging information for module development.
      - ansible.windows.win_package - the ``ensure`` alias for the ``state`` option
        has been deprecated and will be removed in a later release. Please use ``state``
        instead of ``ensure``.
      - ansible.windows.win_package - the ``productid`` alias for the ``product_id``
        option has been deprecated and will be removed in a later release. Please
        use ``product_id`` instead of ``productid``.
      - 'ansible.windows.win_package - the ``username`` and ``password`` options has
        been deprecated and will be removed in a later release. The same functionality
        can be done by using ``become: yes`` and ``become_flags: logon_type=new_credentials
        logon_flags=netcredentials_only`` on the task.'
      - community.aws.data_pipeline - the ``version`` option has been deprecated and
        will be removed in a later release. It has always been ignored by the module.
      - community.aws.ec2_eip - the ``wait_timeout`` option has been deprecated and
        will be removed in a later release. It has had no effect since Ansible 2.3.
      - community.aws.ec2_lc - the ``associate_public_ip_address`` option has been
        deprecated and will be removed in a later release. It has always been ignored
        by the module.
      - community.aws.elb_network_lb - in a later release, the default behaviour for
        the ``state`` option will change from ``absent`` to ``present``.  To maintain
        the existing behavior explicitly set state to ``absent``.
      - community.aws.iam_managed_policy - the ``fail_on_delete`` option has been
        deprecated and will be removed in a later release.  It has always been ignored
        by the module.
      - community.aws.iam_policy - in a later release, the default value for the ``skip_duplicates``
        option will change from ``true`` to ``false``.  To maintain the existing behavior
        explicitly set it to ``true``.
      - community.aws.iam_policy - the ``policy_document`` option has been deprecated
        and will be removed in a later release. To maintain the existing behavior
        use the ``policy_json`` option and read the file with the ``lookup`` plugin.
      - community.aws.iam_role - in a later release, the ``purge_policies`` option
        (also know as ``purge_policy``) default value will change from ``true`` to
        ``false``
      - community.aws.s3_lifecycle - the ``requester_pays`` option has been deprecated
        and will be removed in a later release. It has always been ignored by the
        module.
      - community.aws.s3_sync - the ``retries`` option has been deprecated and will
        be removed in a later release. It has always been ignored by the module.
      - community.vmware.vmware_tag_info - in a later release, the module will not
        return ``tag_facts`` since it does not return multiple tags with the same
        name and different category id. To maintain the existing behavior use ``tag_info``
        which is a list of tag metadata.
      major_changes:
      - 'amazon.aws.ec2 module_utils: The ``AWSRetry`` decorator no longer catches
        ``NotFound`` exceptions by default.  ``NotFound`` exceptions need to be explicitly
        added using ``catch_extra_error_codes``.  Some AWS modules may see an increase
        in transient failures due to AWS''s eventual consistency model.'
