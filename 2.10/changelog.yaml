      known_issues:
      - Due to a limitation in pip, you cannot ``pip install --upgrade`` from ansible-2.9
        or earlier to ansible-2.10 or higher. Instead, you must explicitly use ``pip
        uninstall ansible`` before pip installing the new version. If you attempt
        to upgrade Ansible with pip without first uninstalling, the installer warns
        you to uninstall first.
      - 'The individual collections that make up the ansible-2.10.0 package can be
        viewed independently. However, they are not currently listed by ansible-galaxy.
        To view these collections with ansible-galaxy, explicitly specify where ansible
        has installed the collections -- ``COLLECTION_INSTALL=$(python -c ''import
        ansible, os.path ; print("%s/../ansible_collections" % os.path.dirname(ansible.__file__))'')
        ansible-galaxy collection list -p "$COLLECTION_INSTALL"``.

        '
      - 'These fortios modules are not automatically redirected from their 2.9.x names
        to the new 2.10.x names within collections. You must modify your playbooks
        to use fully qualified collection names for them. You can use the documentation
        (https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/2.10/collections/fortinet/fortios/) for
        the ``fortinet.fortios`` collection to determine what the fully qualified
        collection names are.

  2.10.0a1:
    changes:
      breaking_changes:
      - cisco.nxos.nxos_igmp_interface - no longer supports the deprecated ``oif_prefix``
        and ``oif_source`` options. These have been superceeded by ``oif_ps``.
      - community.grafana.grafana_dashboard - the parameter ``message`` is renamed
        to ``commit_message`` since ``message`` is used by Ansible Core engine internally.
      - purestorage.flashblade.purefb_fs - no longer supports the deprecated ``nfs``
        option. This has been superceeded by ``nfsv3``.
      deprecated_features:
      - The vyos.vyos.vyos_static_route module has been deprecated and will be removed
        in a later release; use vyos.vyos.vyos_static_routes instead.

    changes:
      major_changes:
      - Restricting the version of the community.okd collection to 1.0.0. The previously
        included version, 1.0.1, had a dependency on kubernetes.core and thus required
        the installation of an additional collection that was not included in Ansible
        2.10. Version 1.0.0 is essentially identical to 1.0.1, except that it uses
        community.kubernetes, wihch is included in Ansible 2.10.
