Ansible 11 Porting Guide
========================

.. contents::
  :depth: 2


Ansible 11 is based on Ansible-core 2.18.

We suggest you read this page along with the `Ansible 11 Changelog <https://github.com/ansible-community/ansible-build-data/blob/main/11/CHANGELOG-v11.md>`_ to understand what updates you may need to make.

Playbook
========

No notable changes


Command Line
============

* Python 3.10 is a no longer supported control node version. Python 3.11+ is now required for running Ansible.
* Python 3.7 is a no longer supported remote version. Python 3.8+ is now required for target execution.

Noteworthy module changes

Plugins
=======

* The ``ssh`` connection plugin now officially supports targeting Windows hosts. A
  breaking change that has been made as part of this official support is the low level command
  execution done by plugins like ``ansible.builtin.raw`` and action plugins calling
  ``_low_level_execute_command`` is no longer wrapped with a ``powershell.exe`` wrapped
  invocation. These commands will now be executed directly on the target host using
  the default shell configuration set on the Windows host. This change is done to
  simplify the configuration required on the Ansible side, make module execution more
  efficient, and to remove the need to decode stderr CLIXML output. A consequence of this
  change is that ``ansible.builtin.raw`` commands are no longer guaranteed to be
  run through a PowerShell shell and with the output encoding of UTF-8. To run a command
  through PowerShell and with UTF-8 output support, use the ``ansible.windows.win_shell``
  or ``ansible.windows.win_powershell`` module instead.

  .. code-block:: yaml

      - name: Run with win_shell
        ansible.windows.win_shell: Write-Host "Hello, Café"

      - name: Run with win_powershell
        ansible.windows.win_powershell:
          script: Write-Host "Hello, Café"

You need to explicitly install community.proxmox, for example with ``ansible-galaxy collection install community.proxmox``.

Known Issues
------------

Ansible-core
^^^^^^^^^^^^

- ansible-test - When using ansible-test containers with Podman on a Ubuntu 24.04 host, ansible-test must be run as a non-root user to avoid permission issues caused by AppArmor.
- ansible-test - When using the Fedora 40 container with Podman on a Ubuntu 24.04 host, the ``unix-chkpwd`` AppArmor profile must be disabled on the host to allow SSH connections to the container.

ansible.netcommon
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- libssh - net_put and net_get fail when the destination file intended to be fetched is not present.

community.docker
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- docker_container - when specifying a MAC address for a container's network, and the network is attached after container creation (for example, due to idempotency checks), the MAC address is at least in some cases ignored by the Docker Daemon (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/933).

community.general
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- jenkins_node - the module is not able to update offline message when node is already offline due to internally using toggleOffline API (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/pull/9084).

dellemc.openmanage
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- idrac_diagnostics - Issue(285322) - This module doesn't support export of diagnostics file to HTTP and HTTPS share via SOCKS proxy.
- idrac_firmware - Issue(279282) - This module does not support firmware update using HTTP, HTTPS, and FTP shares with authentication on iDRAC8.

- ome_diagnostics - Issue(279193) - Export of SupportAssist collection logs to the share location fails on OME version 4.0.0.
- ome_smart_fabric_uplink - Issue(186024) - The module supported by OpenManage Enterprise Modular, however it does not allow the creation of multiple uplinks of the same name. If an uplink is created using the same name as an existing uplink, then the existing uplink is modified.

Breaking Changes
----------------

Ansible-core
^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Stopped wrapping all commands sent over SSH on a Windows target with a ``powershell.exe`` executable. This results in one less process being started on each command for Windows to improve efficiency, simplify the code, and make ``raw`` an actual raw command run with the default shell configured on the Windows sshd settings. This should have no affect on most tasks except for ``raw`` which now is not guaranteed to always be running in a PowerShell shell and from having the console output codepage set to UTF-8. To avoid this issue either swap to using ``ansible.windows.win_command``, ``ansible.windows.win_shell``, ``ansible.windows.win_powershell`` or manually wrap the raw command with the shell commands needed to set the output console encoding.
- persistent connection plugins - The ``ANSIBLE_CONNECTION_PATH`` config option no longer has any effect.

amazon.aws
^^^^^^^^^^

- The amazon.aws collection has dropped support for ``botocore<1.31.0`` and ``boto3<1.28.0``. Most modules will continue to work with older versions of the AWS SDK.  However, compatability with older versions of the SDK is not guaranteed and will not be tested. When using older versions of the SDK a warning will be emitted by Ansible (https://github.com/ansible-collections/amazon.aws/pull/2161).
- aws_ec2 - the parameter ``include_extra_api_calls`` was previously deprecated and has been removed (https://github.com/ansible-collections/amazon.aws/pull/2320).
- iam_policy - the ``policies`` return key was previously deprecated and has been removed, please use ``policy_names`` instead (https://github.com/ansible-collections/amazon.aws/pull/2320).
- module_utils.botocore - ``boto3_conn``'s  ``conn_type`` parameter is now mandatory (https://github.com/ansible-collections/amazon.aws/pull/2157).
