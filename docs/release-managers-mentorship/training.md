Step 3: Shadow 2 releases (applies to both Ansible Package and EE releases)
 Doing the releases with screenshare.

How the shadowing needs to be done?

The trainer to go and on video chat,  share their screen with the trainee and follow the process as mentioned in the automated release process as mentioned in the `ansible-build-data` for the Ansible release and this for community ee releases.


The trainer needs to follow their own notes, and/or tips they have which (they think) can be helpful for the trainee to follow.

The trainee needs to take release notes (which can be helpful for them later to go back to the release).

The trainee shares their questions, feedback in training doc and/or the medium of their choice slack or jira.


Step 4: (applies to both)

Adding the trainee in the @release-management wg github team.
Ask the community for permission. Minimum 2 release managers need  to support/endorse  this.
Welcome the new release manager in a formal Forum Post.
