Porting Guide for v10.0.0a3
===========================

Breaking Changes
----------------

community.hrobot
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- robot inventory plugin - ``filters`` is now no longer an alias of ``simple_filters``, but a new, different option (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.hrobot/pull/101).

Major Changes
-------------

community.hrobot
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- The ``community.hrobot`` collection now depends on the ``community.library_inventory_filtering_v1`` collection. This utility collection provides host filtering functionality for inventory plugins. If you use the Ansible community package, both collections are included and you do not have to do anything special. If you install the collection with ``ansible-galaxy collection install``, it will be installed automatically. If you install the collection by copying the files of the collection to a place where ansible-core can find it, for example by cloning the git repository, you need to make sure that you also have to install the dependency if you are using the inventory plugin (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.hrobot/pull/101).

grafana.grafana
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Add a new config part to configure KeyCloak based auth by @he0s in https://github.com/grafana/grafana-ansible-collection/pull/191
- Add promtail role by @voidquark in https://github.com/grafana/grafana-ansible-collection/pull/197
- Bump ansible-lint from 24.2.2 to 24.2.3 by @dependabot in https://github.com/grafana/grafana-ansible-collection/pull/195

Removed Features
----------------

community.grafana
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- removed deprecated `message` argument in `grafana_dashboard`

community.hrobot
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- The collection no longer supports Ansible, ansible-base, and ansible-core releases that are currently End of Life at the time of the 2.0.0 release. This means that Ansible 2.9, ansible-base 2.10, ansible-core 2.11, ansible-core 2.12, ansible-core 2.13, and ansible-core 2.14 are no longer supported. The collection might still work with these versions, but it can stop working at any moment without advance notice, and this will not be considered a bug (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.hrobot/pull/101).

Deprecated Features
-------------------

amazon.aws
~~~~~~~~~~

- cloudformation - the ``template`` parameter has been deprecated and will be removed in a release after 2026-05-01.  The ``template_body`` parameter can be used in conjungtion with the lookup plugin (https://github.com/ansible-collections/amazon.aws/pull/2048).
- module_utils.botocore - the ``boto3`` parameter for ``get_aws_connection_info()`` will be removed in a release after 2025-05-01. The ``boto3`` parameter has been ignored since release 4.0.0 (https://github.com/ansible-collections/amazon.aws/pull/2047).
- module_utils.botocore - the ``boto3`` parameter for ``get_aws_region()`` will be removed in a release after 2025-05-01. The ``boto3`` parameter has been ignored since release 4.0.0 (https://github.com/ansible-collections/amazon.aws/pull/2047).
- module_utils.ec2 - the ``boto3`` parameter for ``get_ec2_security_group_ids_from_names()`` will be removed in a release after 2025-05-01. The ``boto3`` parameter has been ignored since release 4.0.0 (https://github.com/ansible-collections/amazon.aws/pull/2047).

community.general
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- hipchat callback plugin - the hipchat service has been discontinued and the self-hosted variant has been End of Life since 2020. The callback plugin is therefore deprecated and will be removed from community.general 10.0.0 if nobody provides compelling reasons to still keep it (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/issues/8184, https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/pull/8189).

community.vmware
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- vmware_guest_tools_info - `vm_tools_install_status` will be removed from next major version (5.0.0) of the collection since the API call that provides this information has been deprecated by VMware.

Ansible-core
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Old style vars plugins which use the entrypoints `get_host_vars` or `get_group_vars` are deprecated. The plugin should be updated to inherit from `BaseVarsPlugin` and define a `get_vars` method as the entrypoint.
- The 'required' parameter in 'ansible.module_utils.common.process.get_bin_path' API is deprecated (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/82464).
- ``module_utils`` - importing the following convenience helpers from ``ansible.module_utils.basic`` has been deprecated: ``get_exception``, ``literal_eval``, ``_literal_eval``, ``datetime``, ``signal``, ``types``, ``chain``, ``repeat``, ``PY2``, ``PY3``, ``b``, ``binary_type``, ``integer_types``, ``iteritems``, ``string_types``, ``test_type``, ``map`` and ``shlex_quote``.

amazon.aws
~~~~~~~~~~

- iam_role_info - in a release after 2026-05-01 paths must begin and end with ``/`` (https://github.com/ansible-collections/amazon.aws/pull/1998).

community.crypto
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- openssl_csr_pipe, openssl_privatekey_pipe, x509_certificate_pipe - the current behavior of check mode is deprecated and will change in community.crypto 3.0.0. The current behavior is similar to the modules without ``_pipe``: if the object needs to be (re-)generated, only the ``changed`` status is set, but the object is not updated. From community.crypto 3.0.0 on, the modules will ignore check mode and always act as if check mode is not active. This behavior can already achieved now by adding ``check_mode: false`` to the task. If you think this breaks your use-case of this module, please `create an issue in the community.crypto repository <https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/issues/new/choose>`__ (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/issues/712, https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.crypto/pull/714).

community.dns

community.docker
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- docker_container - the default ``ignore`` for the ``image_name_mismatch`` parameter has been deprecated and will switch to ``recreate`` in community.docker 4.0.0. A deprecation warning will be printed in situations where the default value is used and where a behavior would change once the default changes (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.docker/pull/703).

community.general
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- consul_acl - the module has been deprecated and will be removed in community.general 10.0.0. ``consul_token`` and ``consul_policy`` can be used instead (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.general/pull/7901).

community.hrobot
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- robot inventory plugin - the ``filters`` option has been renamed to ``simple_filters``. The old name will stop working in community.hrobot 2.0.0 (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.hrobot/pull/94).
